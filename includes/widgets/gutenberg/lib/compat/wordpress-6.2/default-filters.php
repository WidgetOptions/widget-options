 * If a hook should only be called from a specific context

 * This is a temporary fix to ensure that the block editor styles are enqueued
 * in the order the iframe expects.
 *
 * The wp_enqueue_registered_block_scripts_and_styles callback has been removed in core
 * as of https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/pull/4356.
 *
 * However, Gutenberg supports WordPress 6.1 and 6.2, which still have this callback.
 * Hence, why we remove it first and then re-add it.
 *
 * This way we make sure it still works the same in WordPress trunk, 6.1 and 6.2.
