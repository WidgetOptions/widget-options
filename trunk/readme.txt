<h3>MORE OPTIONS IN THE WIDGET SETTINGS MEANS MORE CONTROL</h3>

With the expanded widget settings that Widget Options bring, you can do all of the following with ease. 

<h4>SHOW OR HIDE WIDGETS ON SPECIFIC WORDPRESS PAGES</h4>
With the Widget Options plugin, you can easily control every widget’s visibility or restrictions on different pages, posts, custom post types, categories, tags, and custom taxonomies. 

<h4>SHOW OR HIDE WIDGETS ON MOBILE DEVICES, DESKTOP AND/OR TABLET</h4>
Display fewer widgets on your mobile devices for easier website navigation without affecting your desktop and tablet versions. This is one of the features of Widget Options that proves it to be a flexible widget area manager. The device visibility section in the widget settings show which sidebar widgets are active or visible in each device type. 

<h4>CUSTOM WORDPRESS WIDGET ALIGNMENTS</h4>
Change your widget alignment to match the entire look of your website. Comes with <strong>center, left, right, and justified alignment</strong> options.

<h4>CUSTOM WIDGET ID & CLASSES</h4>
Create predefined classes on the plugin’s settings page and use them later for each widget. You can also add custom widget ID and additional classes for styling or javascript purposes.

<h4>DISPLAY WIDGET LOGIC</h4>
Use <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Conditional_Tags">WordPress Conditional tags</a> to manage and restrict your widgets using display widget logic option if you’re geeky enough to use PHP conditions and in need of custom restrictions.

<h4>HIDE WIDGET TITLE</h4>
Easily hide widget titles from the front-end display while retaining them on the backend dashboard for labeling.

<h4>ENABLE / DISABLE OPTIONS</h4>
Use only the features you want and disable any other widget options easily using the brand new settings page.

<h4>USER LOGIN STATE</h4>
Decide which widgets have to be visible or invisible to either logged-in or non-logged-in users. This feature is helpful when you want certain website functions to be available only to registered users.

<h4>STICKY/FIXED WORDPRESS WIDGETS (Premium)</h4>
This premium feature allows widgets to be always visible to users as they scroll up and down a webpage. Make your most important widgets sticky or fixed so that users can access them easily.

<h3>WIDGET OPTIONS’ TIME-SAVING FEATURES</h3>

Widget plugins shouldn’t only give you control over your widgets. They must also save you a lot of time! Here are Widget Options’ features that can do that.

<h4>LIVE WIDGET SEARCH FILTER</h4>
Admins save time and manage widgets more efficiently by enabling the live widget search box on your widget dashboard to locate widgets easier. No need to scroll the page.

<h4>NO NEED TO DRAG WORDPRESS WIDGETS TO MOVE THEM</h4>
Increase productivity and improve widgets management by moving any widgets easily with just a click-and-select action. No more drag-and-drop! This is a convenient option especially when using small-screen devices such as tablets or mobile phones.

<h4>IMPORT & EXPORT WIDGETS AND WIDGET AREA BACKUP</h4>
You can now import and export WordPress widgets easily and create backups of specific sidebar widget areas. Move widgets to another website with ease.

<h4>VIEW YOUR CHANGES LIVE</h4>
This plugin is customizer-ready for easier modification. View your changes live before saving it. 

<h3>COMPATIBLE WITH THE MOST POPULAR PAGE BUILDERS</h3>

Not all widget plugins are designed to work with page builders. If your websites use SiteOrigin, Elementor, or Beaver, you can make the most of Widget Options. This is another reason why we call it the most flexible widget area manager!

<h4>PAGE BUILDER BY SITEORIGIN PLUGIN COMPATIBLE</h4>
With Widget Options on your website that is powered by SiteOrigin Page Builder, you can add more control to the widget panels. Manage visibility on specific device types, change alignments, hide widget panel title, add custom classes, and control visibility using display widget logic option! 

<strong>Page Builder by SiteOrigin Plugin + Widget Options = Total Freedom!</strong>

<h4>ELEMENTOR PAGE BUILDER READY</h4>
Extend Widget Options’ visibility restrictions on elementor widgets! You can now have the same widget management features available to your Elementor-powered websites.

<h4>BEAVER BUILDER PLUGIN READY</h4>
Widget Options now comes with Beaver Builder plugin integration – integrated for a smooth website building workflow. You can fully manage each module in many ways you want! 

<h4>ADVANCED CUSTOM FIELDS (ACF) SUPPORT</h4>
Easily show or hide any widget using your ACF fields and conditions. You can create restrictions on your widgets with the following conditions:

* Equal To
* Not Equal To
* Contains
* Does Not Contain
* Is Empty
* Is Not Empty

The ACF function is also available for Elementor and Beaver Builder.
